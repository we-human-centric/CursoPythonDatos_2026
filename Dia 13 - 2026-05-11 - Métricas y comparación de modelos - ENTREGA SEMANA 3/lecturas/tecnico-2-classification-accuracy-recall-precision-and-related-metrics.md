Classification: Accuracy, recall, precision, and related metrics 

Stay organized with collections

True and false positives and negatives are used to calculate several useful
metrics for evaluating models. Which evaluation metrics are most
meaningful depends on the specific model and the specific task, the cost
of different misclassifications, and whether the dataset is balanced or
imbalanced.

All of the metrics in this section are calculated at a single fixed threshold,
and change when the threshold changes. Very often, the user tunes the
threshold to optimize one of these metrics.

Accuracy

Accuracy is the proportion of all
classifications that were correct, whether positive or negative. It is
mathematically defined as:

\[\text{Accuracy} =
\frac{\text{correct classifications}}{\text{total classifications}}
= \frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP+FN}\]

In the spam classification example, accuracy measures the fraction of all
emails correctly classified. 

A perfect model would have zero false positives and zero false negatives, and
therefore an accuracy of 1.0, or 100%.

Because it incorporates all four outcomes from the
confusion matrix 
(TP, FP, TN, FN), given a balanced
dataset, with similar numbers of examples in both classes, accuracy can
serve as a coarse-grained measure of model quality. For this reason, it is often
the default evaluation metric used for generic or unspecified models
carrying out generic or unspecified tasks.

However, when the dataset is imbalanced,
or where one kind of mistake (FN or FP) is more costly than the other, which is
the case in most real-world applications, it's better to optimize for one of
the other metrics instead.

For heavily imbalanced datasets, where one class appears very rarely, say 1% of
the time, a model that predicts negative 100% of the time would score 99% on
accuracy, despite being useless.

Note: In machine learning (ML), words like
recall , precision , and accuracy have mathematical
definitions that may differ from, or be more specific than, more commonly
used meanings of the word. 

Recall, or true positive rate

The true positive rate (TPR) , or the proportion of all actual positives that
were classified correctly as positives, is also known as
recall .

Recall is mathematically defined as:

\[\text{Recall (or TPR)} =
\frac{\text{correctly classified actual positives}}{\text{all actual positives}}
= \frac{TP}{TP+FN}\]

False negatives are actual positives that were misclassified as negatives, which
is why they appear in the denominator. In the spam classification example,
recall measures the fraction of spam emails that were correctly classified as
spam. This is why another name for recall is probability of detection : it
answers the question "What fraction of spam emails are detected by this
model?"

A hypothetical perfect model would have zero false negatives and therefore a
recall (TPR) of 1.0, which is to say, a 100% detection rate.

In an imbalanced dataset where the number of actual positives is very
low, recall is a more meaningful metric than accuracy because it
measures the ability of the model to correctly identify all positive instances.
For applications like disease prediction, correctly identifying the positive
cases is crucial. A false negative typically has more serious consequences
than a false positive. For a concrete example comparing recall and accuracy
metrics, see the notes in the definition of
recall .

False positive rate

The false positive rate (FPR) 
is the proportion of all actual negatives that were classified incorrectly 
as positives, also known as the probability of false alarm. It is
mathematically defined as:

\[\text{FPR} =
\frac{\text{incorrectly classified actual negatives}}
{\text{all actual negatives}}
= \frac{FP}{FP+TN}\]

False positives are actual negatives that were misclassified, which is why they
appear in the denominator. In the spam classification example, FPR measures the
fraction of legitimate emails that were incorrectly classified as spam, or the
model's rate of false alarms.

A perfect model would have zero false positives and therefore a FPR of 0.0,
which is to say, a 0% false alarm rate.

For an imbalanced dataset, FPR is generally a more informative metric than
accuracy. However, if the number of actual negatives is very low, FPR may not be
an ideal choice, due to its volatility. For example, if there are only four
actual negatives in a dataset, one misclassification results in an FPR of 25%,
while a second misclassification causes the FPR to jump to 50%. In cases like
this, precision (described next) may be a more stable metric for
evaluating the effects of false positives.

Precision

Precision 
is the proportion of all the model's positive classifications
that are actually positive. It is mathematically defined as:

\[\text{Precision} =
\frac{\text{correctly classified actual positives}}
{\text{everything classified as positive}}
= \frac{TP}{TP+FP}\]

In the spam classification example, precision measures the fraction of emails
classified as spam that were actually spam. 

A hypothetical perfect model would have zero false positives and therefore a
precision of 1.0.

In an imbalanced dataset where the number of actual positives is very, very
low, say 1-2 examples in total, precision is less meaningful and less useful
as a metric.

Precision improves as false positives decrease, while recall improves when
false negatives decrease. But as seen in the previous section, increasing the
classification threshold tends to decrease the number of false positives and
increase the number of false negatives, while decreasing the threshold has the
opposite effects. As a result, precision and recall often show an inverse
relationship, where improving one of them worsens the other.

Try it yourself:

What does NaN mean in the metrics?

NaN, or "not a number," appears when dividing by 0, which can happen
with any of these metrics. When TP and FP are both 0, for example, the
formula for precision has 0 in the denominator, resulting in NaN. While
in some cases NaN can indicate perfect performance and could be
replaced by a score of 1.0, it can also come from a model that is practically
useless. A model that never predicts positive, for example, would have 0 TPs
and 0 FPs and thus a calculation of its precision would result in NaN.

Choice of metric and tradeoffs

The metric(s) you choose to prioritize when evaluating the model and
choosing a threshold depend on the costs, benefits, and risks of the
specific problem. In the spam classification example, it often makes
sense to prioritize recall, nabbing all the spam emails, or precision,
trying to ensure that spam-labeled emails are in fact spam, or some
balance of the two, above some minimum accuracy level.

Guidance 

Accuracy 

Use as a rough indicator of model
training progress/convergence for balanced datasets.

For model performance, use only in combination with other metrics.

Avoid for imbalanced datasets. Consider using another metric.

Recall
(True positive rate) 
Use when false negatives are more
expensive than false positives. 

False positive rate 
Use when false positives are
more expensive than false negatives. 

Precision 
Use when it's very important for
positive predictions to be accurate. 

(Optional, advanced) F1 score

The F1 score is the harmonic mean (a
kind of average) of precision and recall.

Mathematically, it is given by:

\[\text{F1}=2*\frac{\text{precision * recall}}{\text{precision + recall}}
= \frac{2\text{TP}}{2\text{TP + FP + FN}}\]

This metric balances the importance of precision and recall, and is
preferable to accuracy for class-imbalanced datasets. When precision
and recall both have perfect scores of 1.0, F1 will also have a perfect score
of 1.0. More broadly, when precision and recall are close in value, F1 will
be close to their value. When precision and recall are far apart, F1 will
be similar to whichever metric is worse.

You're building a binary classifier that checks photos of insect traps
for whether a dangerous invasive species is present. If the model detects
the species, the entomologist (insect scientist) on duty is notified. Early
detection of this insect is critical to preventing an infestation. A
false alarm (false positive) is easy to handle: the entomologist sees that
the photo was misclassified and marks it as such. Assuming an acceptable
accuracy level, which metric should this model be optimized for?

Recall

In this scenario, false alarms (FP) are low-cost, and false
negatives are highly costly, so it makes sense to maximize recall, or the probability of
detection.

False positive rate (FPR)

In this scenario, false alarms (FP) are low-cost. Trying
to minimize them at the risk of missing actual positives doesn't make
sense.

Precision

In this scenario, false alarms (FP) aren't particularly
harmful, so trying to improve the correctness of positive classifications
doesn't make sense.
